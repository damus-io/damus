/// DamusVideoCoordinator is responsible for coordinating the various video players throughout the app, and providing a nicely orchestrated experience.
/// The goals of this object are to:
/// - ensure some video playing states (such as mute state and current time) are consistent across different video player view instances of the same video
/// - ensure only one video is playing at a time
/// - Provide global video playback controls to control the currently playing video
///
/// This is used as a singleton object (one global object per `DamusState`), which gets passed around to video players, which can then interact with the coordinator to ensure an app-wide coherent experience
///
/// A good analogy here is that video players and their models/states are like individual cars and their drivers, and this coordinator is like a traffic control person + traffic lights that ensures cars don't crash each other.
