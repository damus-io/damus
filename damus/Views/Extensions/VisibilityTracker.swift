    /// 
    /// ## Usage notes
    /// 
    /// 1. Detection mechanisms are not perfect, parameters may need fine tuning. Please refer to `VisibilityTracker` documentation for more details.
    /// 2. This does **not** detect if the view has been occluded. There are currently no known mechanisms to do that.
    ///   If occlusion tracking is needed for your usage, consider using layout knowledge/introspection of the different layers that make up the view, and using that information for your logic.
    ///   For example, when dealing with items on a normal view, and a full screen cover, write your logic based on explicit information about which views are in the full screen layer.
    ///   Read about `present(full_screen_item: FullScreenItem)`, `damus_full_screen_cover`, and the `.view_layer_context` environment variable.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - visibility_change_notifier: Function to call once visibility changes
    ///   - edge: Edge for the visibility overlay sensor
    ///   - method: The method to use for visibility tracking. Refer to `VisibilityTracker` documentation for more details.
    /// - Returns: A modified view.
