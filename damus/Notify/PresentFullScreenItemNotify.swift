/// Tell the app to present an item in full screen. Use this when presenting items coming from a timeline or any lazy stack.
///
/// ## Usage notes
///
/// Use this instead of `.damus_full_screen_cover` when the source view is on a lazy stack or timeline.
///
/// The reason is that when using a full screen modifier in those scenarios, the full screen view may abruptly disappear.
/// One example is when showing videos from the timeline in full screen, where changing the orientation of the device (landscape/portrait)
/// can cause the source view to be unloaded by the lazy stack, making your full screen overlay to simply disappear, causing a feeling of flakiness to the app
///
/// ## Implementation notes
///
/// The requests from this function will be received and handled at the top level app view (`ContentView`), which contains a `.damus_full_screen_cover`.
///
