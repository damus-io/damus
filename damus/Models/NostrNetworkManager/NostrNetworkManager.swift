/// This delineates a layer that is responsible for doing mid-level management of interactions with the Nostr network, controlling lower-level classes that perform more network/DB specific code, and providing an easier to use and more semantic interfaces for the rest of the app.
///
/// This is responsible for:
/// - Managing the user's relay list
/// - Establishing a `RelayPool` and maintaining it in sync with the user's relay list as it changes
/// - Abstracting away complexities of interacting with the nostr network, providing an easier-to-use interface to fetch and send content related to the Nostr network
///
/// This is **NOT** responsible for:
/// - Doing actual storage of relay list (delegated via the delegate
/// - Handling low-level relay logic (this will be delegated to lower level classes used in RelayPool/RelayConnection)
