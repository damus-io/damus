## Getting Started on Damus 

### **Side Menu:** 
To open the side menu, click on your profile picture on the top left corner of any view.

 - **Profile:** To access your profile, click on either 'Profile' in the side menu, or on the enlarged image of your profile picture or your name at the top of the side menu.

 - **Blocked:** Shows a list of all the accounts you've blocked. To block an account, you can either go to the user's profile and tap the three dots in the top right corner, or press and hold a note and select 'Block' from the list. You can remove a user from the list by swiping left and selecting the red trash can to unblock them.

 - **Relays:** Shows a list of all the relays you're connected to. To add more relays to send your notes to, tap the '+' button. The page also displays some recommended relays at the bottom to get you started. Clicking on a relay shows information about it. A green dollar sign indicates that it is a paid relay, and you can find more information about its monetization by clicking on it. You can also find new relays to connect to by clicking the 'Relays' button on other people's profiles, located next to 'Following/Followers'. Additionally, there are online directories, such as [nostr.watch/](http://nostr.watch/) that list relays.

### **Settings:**
also found in the side menu

- **Public Account ID** (nPub) is your public, personal address that people can use to find and tag you.
- **Secret Account Login Key** (nSec) is a private key unique to you. Never share your private key publicly and use it with other clients at your own risk.
- **Wallet Selector** includes options such as 'Show Wallet Selection' to display a share sheet of wallets for zapping or paying invoices, which is useful for people who use multiple wallets. 'Select Default Wallet' sets the wallet that automatically opens up for zapping or paying invoices when 'Show Wallet Selection' is off. 'Default Zap Amount In Sats' is the amount generated by the zap button on notes to create an invoice.
- In the **'Translation'** section, you can set up LibreTranslate or DeepL to translate notes in foreign languages (DeepL requires an API key). 
- The **'Left Handed'** option changes the location of the 'New Post' button + found on the home screen from the right side of the screen to the left.

### **Bottom Navigation Bar:**
- **Home:** The home feed displays content from everyone you follow and can be sorted by 'Posts' (only top-level posts) and 'Posts & Replies'. To post a note, simply tap the purple '+' button.

- **DMs:** Here you will find all your direct messages. The messages themselves are encrypted, but who you are sending messages too is viewable by anyone with your pubkey. Initially, there may not be any messages to see. To start a new DM Go to a user profile and tap the chat icon next to the follow button. DMs and Requests are sorted at the top.

- Search / Universe: On the top of this page, you can search for users using their pubkey or name, search for specific notes using the note ID, and search for hashtags.The 'Universe', formally known as 'Global', initially displays the most recent top-level note from each person connected to all the relays you follow. In the top right corner, you will see an icon with three horizontal lines. Clicking on this icon allows you to filter which relays your ‘universe’ displays.
- **Notifications:** Here you will find notifications about your mentions, reposts, and zaps.

  
### **Sending a Note:** 
To post a note, simply tap the purple '+' button found on the home screen.

- **Tagging a User:** If you are already connected to a user, they should show up in automatic tagging. When composing a note just type @ and then their name and you should be able to select them from a list of users that appears at the bottom of the screen. If this doesn’t work, you can copy their pubkey from either their profile or by hard pressing a note of theirs and adding an @ before their nPub.

 - **Share Image:** Simply paste an Image URL (a url that ends in .jpg, .png, .gif, ect.) into the body of your note. Currently images only load for people you follow in the home feed. Images will be blurred in the universe until you expand them.

- **Share (Quote) Note:** you can quote a note by long pressing on a note and copying the Note ID, just as you would tag a user, you add @ before a note ID in the body of your note and it will link and render a preview of the note.

### **Engaging with Notes:**

- **Replying to a Note:** To reply to a note, tap the chat dialog icon located beneath the note. If the note is part of a conversation with multiple people or if multiple people are mentioned in the note, click on 'Replying to:' at the top of the screen to choose who you are specifically replying to.

- **Reposts:** To repost a note, tap the repost icon. The repost will then appear on your profile under 'Posts & Replies' and will be displayed to your followers on the home screen under 'Posts & Replies'.

- **Reactions:** To react to a note, tap the shaka icon. Other users will be able to see that you reacted to the note, and some clients might display a list of all the notes that you've reacted to.

- **Zaps:** To generate a lightning invoice for a note, tap the lightning icon. The invoice will be in the amount you set under 'Default Zap Amount in Sats' in your settings. If 'Show Wallet Selection' is off, your wallet will open automatically. If 'Show Wallet Selection' is on, you'll see a list of wallets to choose from and an option to copy just the LNBC link at the top of the share sheet. If the receiver has a wallet that supports Zaps, the total amount will show on their note. You can expand the note to see a list of who has zapped that note and how much, and the note author will receive a notification that you zapped them.

### **Profile Edit:** 
go to your profile through the side menu and on the top right hand click edit.

- **Your Name:** This is the bold name on your profile.
- **Username:** this is the @username that will be used to mention you on damus.

*(note: other clients are free to use whichever of these two names they want for mentions, you might want them to be the same if you want the way you're mentioned crossed nostr to be the same)**

- **Profile & Banner Image:** much like sharing a picture in a note, you also use an Image URL to link to an image you want to use as a PFP or Banner. Simply paste an Image URL (a url that ends in .jpg, .png, .gif, ect.) into this field to set your PFP or Banner Image.

- **Website:** A place to list a website on your profile
- **About Me:** A place to list a bio on your profile

  
- **Bitcoin Lightning Tips:** This is your receiving address for both Zaps (the lightning button on notes) and Profile Zaps (the lightning button on profiles). It should be a Lightning Address, and it’s even better if the wallet supports NIP 57 for true Zaps so you can see and receive notification of the Zaps directly on Damus.

### Translations

Translators welcome! Join the [Transifex][transifex] project.

All user-facing strings must have a comment in order to provide context to translators. If a SwiftUI component has a `comment` parameter, use that. Otherwise, wrap your string with `NSLocalizedString` with the `comment` field populated.
