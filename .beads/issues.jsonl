{"id":"damus-eld","title":"Investigate: Relate WebSocket testing infrastructure to PR #3353 (Offline Indicator + Outbox)","description":"Investigate how the WebSocket testing infrastructure (Phase 1 \u0026 2) relates to PR #3353.\n\n## PR #3353 Summary: Offline Indicator + Outbox Upgrade\n\n**GitHub:** https://github.com/damus-io/damus/pull/3353\n**Status:** Open\n**Changes:** +1257 / -59 lines across 30 files\n\n### What It Adds\n1. **Offline indicator UI** - Pills in timeline, compose view showing offline state\n2. **Outbox queue** - PendingPostStore for drafts that send when back online\n3. **NWPathMonitor** - Reachability tracking in SignalModel\n4. **PostBox enhancements** - Retry logic, exponential backoff, stale cleanup\n5. **Auto-send on reconnect** - Pending posts flush when connectivity restored\n\n### Key Files Changed\n- `SignalModel.swift` - Added NWPathMonitor reachability tracking\n- `PostBox.swift` - Added pending post handling with retry caps\n- `PendingPostStore.swift` - **New** - Persistence for offline posts\n- `OutboxView.swift` - **New** - UI for pending posts queue\n\n---\n\n## Relationship to Our Testing Infrastructure\n\n### Direct Overlaps\n\n| Our Work | PR #3353 | Relationship |\n|----------|----------|--------------|\n| MockWebSocket | SignalModel connectivity | MockWebSocket can simulate offline→online transitions |\n| RelayConnectionTests (backoff) | PostBox retry/backoff | Same exponential backoff pattern, should align |\n| RelayIntegrationTests | Outbox flush on reconnect | Test that pending posts actually send |\n| sitespeedio/throttle CI | Offline testing | Throttle to 100% loss = offline simulation |\n\n### How MockWebSocket Helps Test PR #3353\n\n1. **Simulate offline state:**\n   ```swift\n   mockSocket.simulateDisconnect()\n   // Verify SignalModel.isOffline == true\n   // Verify offline pill appears\n   ```\n\n2. **Simulate reconnection:**\n   ```swift\n   mockSocket.simulateConnect()\n   // Verify pending posts flush\n   // Verify OK received for each\n   ```\n\n3. **Simulate partial connectivity:**\n   ```swift\n   // 2/5 relays connected\n   // Verify app shows 'online' (at least one relay works)\n   ```\n\n### Tests PR #3353 Already Added\n- `SignalModelTests.swift` - Reachability logic\n- `PendingPostStoreTests.swift` - Persistence, trimming\n- `OfflineIndicatorLogicTests.swift` - UI pill logic\n- `damusUITests.swift` - Offline indicator in composer\n\n### Gap: Missing Integration Tests\nPR #3353 tests individual components but lacks:\n- End-to-end offline→post→reconnect→verify published test\n- Multi-relay partial failure scenarios\n- Race condition: reconnect during flush\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### 1. Align Backoff Constants\nPR #3353 adds retry caps and backoff in PostBox. Compare with RelayConnection backoff:\n- RelayConnection: `backoff *= 2.0` starting at 1.0s\n- PostBox: Check if aligned or conflicts\n\n### 2. Add Integration Test for Outbox Flush\nUsing our infrastructure:\n```swift\nfunc testOutboxFlushesOnReconnect() async {\n    // 1. Start offline (all MockWebSockets disconnected)\n    // 2. Create pending post via PostBox\n    // 3. Simulate reconnect\n    // 4. Verify EVENT sent and OK received\n    // 5. Verify post removed from PendingPostStore\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Test SignalModel with MockWebSocket\nSignalModel uses NWPathMonitor + relay count. Test:\n- Zero relays configured = offline\n- All relays disconnected = offline  \n- One relay connected = online\n\n### 4. CI Workflow Enhancement\nAdd offline simulation to network-tests.yml:\n```yaml\n- name: Test offline mode\n  run: |\n    sudo throttle --profile 100loss\n    # Run outbox tests\n    sudo throttle --stop\n```\n\n---\n\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Review PR #3353 backoff logic vs RelayConnection backoff\n- [ ] Add OutboxIntegrationTests using MockWebSocket\n- [ ] Ensure SignalModel tests use MockWebSocket for relay state\n- [ ] Consider contributing tests back to PR #3353","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-03T22:04:44.948544-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-03T22:05:16.447765-06:00","created_by":"e"}
