Ephemeral Relays
================

Ephemeral relays are relays that exist in your relay pool but not on your
published relays on your profile. These are used for various purposes,
such as communicating with NWC relays and following note relay hints.

Ephemeral relays are marked with the ephemeral tag on RelayInfo in the relay
descriptor.
