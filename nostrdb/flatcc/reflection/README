NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS: DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES BY HAND

If you need to change anything here, it is done in the code generator,
possibly followed by running `reflection/generate_code.sh` from the
project root. But please only do this for testing do not include the
generated files in a pull request unless agreed otherwise, and if so,
do it in a separate commit.

Normally new reflection code is generated during a release which also
updates the version number in comments and there is no reason to update
reflection on every commit unless it breaks something fundamentally.

There is a build option `FLATCC_REFLECTION` to disable reflection which
is helpful while making changes that affect the content of these files
in a way that would prevent the flatcc compiler from building.
